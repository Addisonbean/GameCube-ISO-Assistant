# GameCube ISO Assistant

This project aims to create a way to view the contents of a GameCube ROM, but I eventually plan on expanding it to be able to rebuild ROMs, and probably other cool stuff. I'd like to create a Rust API for all of this as well at some point.

Here's a link to a reference to some documentation I'm working on for the GameCube ROM format: [GameCube ROM Info](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uuLgEZhlXwPBKyDEFGLU_g_7azzA60bv5O3kPxXZmyE/edit?usp=sharing)
